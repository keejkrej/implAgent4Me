"""Abstract base class for pluggable memory providers.

Memory providers give the agent persistent recall across sessions.
The MemoryManager enforces a one-external-provider limit to prevent
tool schema bloat and conflicting memory backends.

External providers (Honcho, Hindsight, Mem0, etc.) are registered
and managed via MemoryManager. Only one external provider runs at a
time.

Registration:
  Plugins ship in plugins/memory/<name>/ and are activated via
  the memory.provider config key.

Lifecycle (called by MemoryManager, wired in run_agent.py):
  initialize()          — connect, create resources, warm up
  system_prompt_block()  — static text for the system prompt
  prefetch(query)        — background recall before each turn
  sync_turn(user, asst)  — async write after each turn
  get_tool_schemas()     — tool schemas to expose to the model
  handle_tool_call()     — dispatch a tool call
  shutdown()             — clean exit

Optional hooks (override to opt in):
  on_turn_start(turn, message, **kwargs) — per-turn tick with runtime context
  on_session_end(messages)               — end-of-session extraction
  on_session_switch(new_session_id, **kwargs) — mid-process session_id rotation
  on_pre_compress(messages) -> str       — extract before context compression
  on_memory_write(action, target, content, metadata=None) — mirror built-in memory writes
  on_delegation(task, result, **kwargs)  — parent-side observation of subagent work
