// prevents a cancel recorded between the drain and the check from being
// observed inconsistently.
//
// Calls covered by a pending cancel are dropped; the dropped ones that
// carry a RunID are returned in canceledWithRunID so the caller can
// publish their terminal cancelled RunComplete (a caller waiting on that
// RunID, e.g. `crush run`, would otherwise hang). Uncanceled calls without
// a RunID are returned in fold to be folded into the active turn,
// preserving the existing follow-up behavior. Uncanceled calls that carry
// a RunID are left in the queue so each runs as its own turn via the
// recursive run path and publishes its own RunComplete, giving every
// RunID-bearing prompt an explicit lifecycle instead of being silently
// absorbed into another turn. fold is processed by the caller without the
// lock held.
